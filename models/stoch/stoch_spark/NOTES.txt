=================
COMPILING:

-Run "make"
-The Spirit_Wrapper class is very slow with Intel compilers due to templates. Use the GNU compiler if this is an issue.
-Note "-fopenmp" and "-openmp" are compiler flags for GNU and Intel compilers, respectively

=================
RUNNING:

-Set parameters in "params.txt"
-Run "./stoch3d"

=================
OPENMP:

-Model uses OpenMP for thread-level parallelization of CRU and SL compartment computations (#pragma statements in fcn.cc and mpi_master.cc)

-Command for setting number of OpenMP threads:
>> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=N
This should usually be set to the number of CPU cores. If it is not set, OpenMP will automatically choose.

-To check value:
>> echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS

OpenMP calls are at the #pragma statements in mpi_master.cc and fcn.cc

=================
OUTPUT:

-Main output is in info.0.txt (includes states, currents, other_states)
-FRU info and VTK files for Paraview will be put in directory "stochout" if it exists
